# LAP 2 Paired assignment

## Installation

- Clone or download the repo
- Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed and running

## Usage

- Make sure you are CD'd into LAP2PAIR then run docker `compose -f docker-compose-2.yaml -f docker-compose-3.yaml up`
- use `http://localhost:3000` to access the database and use `http://localhost:8080` to access the client.

## Bugs

- Client page isn't running functions correctly, page shouldn't show entries and undefined initially.
- Posting to the database doesn't work.
- Client side isn't functioning.

## Wins

- You can insert and retrieve from the database.
- Database schema is good and working.
- The information pulled from the form is good.
- The information submitted is turned into a json ready to be imported into database.

## Challenges

- Struggled to get the docker file running correctly.
- Couldn't work out front end functions once we had the database running.
- Confusion with async await functions.
- Some issues with merging on github along the way.
